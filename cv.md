### About me  
> Hello! I’m 29 years old. During 5 years I had worked as engineer-geodesist. I’ve succeed in this area of activity. But I’ve seen that IT area has more tools for self-development, great community and transparent performance standards. 
My goal is getting knowledges and use my skills from field of construction (like reading and correcting plans and shemes) to front-end developing, so it’s a challenge and great opportunity to change a sphere of activity.
